     * driven entirely by percentage/auto dimensions with no definite-size ancestor
     * — e.g. an inline `<svg>` that has only a `viewBox` (no width/height attrs)

     * (e.g. `scale`) still runs, but on a 0×0 box, so nothing shows.

     * GSAP's `pinSpacing` sidesteps this by wrapping the pinned element in a div
     * with a FIXED width/height to match its rendered size. To achieve the same,
     * when the in-flow measurement is degenerate (0 width or height) we briefly
     * take the element out of the shrink-to-fit flow (`position: absolute`, hidden
     * to avoid any flash) so its percentage/`max-*` dimensions resolve against a
     * real containing block, read the recovered rect, then restore the exact prior
     * inline styles. The recovery is used only when it actually yields a non-zero
     * box; otherwise the original rect is returned unchanged.

     * Non-degenerate elements skip the recovery entirely, so normal pins are
     * byte-identical to before.
